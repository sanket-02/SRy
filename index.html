        <h6>I owe you a big apology. I’m really sorry for not trusting your words and jumping to conclusions. I know it wasn’t fair of me to doubt you or to ask for the screenshot of your call history. I let my emotions get the better of me, and I didn’t stop to think about how it might make you feel.
You’ve always been such an amazing friend to me, and I should have trusted you like you’ve always trusted me. I feel awful for making you go through this. I hope you can forgive me for being such a silly overthinker. I promise to do better and to trust you the way you deserve.</h6>
